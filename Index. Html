      In a quiet village, a calm and good-hearted boy lived alone. But the people from his clan constantly watched him and kept disturbing him. During this time, his clan members discovered something called Ovjarb, and they began announcing his every move out loud.

He never asked them, “Why are you bothering me?”
He already knew their answer. They would lie and say, “You have a problem in your head.”

This harassment had a long history. His great-grandfather had never given clan property to anyone, and because of that, the clan members never missed a chance to annoy him, even since childhood.

Now, they started bothering him even more because he had begun studying in class 10. They wanted to pressure him so much that he would leave the village and go back to his family.

Their plan was simple:
After he left, they would pretend to care. They would ask him why he went away and try to spread rumors that he had mental problems. Later, they would say he suddenly left without telling anyone the reason.

He understood their intentions very well, so he stayed silent and ignored everything.

In school, many girls liked him because he was calm, kind, peaceful, and rarely showed strong emotions. Most of the pretty girls admired him. Even teachers and students found him interesting because his personality was different from everyone else.

Because of this, every Friday, the villagers became jealous of him. And after hearing about his life, the whole village became jealous and started bothering him even more. Even students from his school joined them, trying to figure out why he was different.

Their use of Ovjarb reached a new level. They started predicting his thoughts. Their voices reached him through speakers placed around the village, or through people using their mobile phones to send their voices to him.
They accidentally discovered another method called Sounth, and from then on, they kept disturbing him using both Ovjarb and Sounth together.

After Sounth spread through the village, even vehicle drivers started saying her life through the horns of their vehicles.

Wherever he went, he heard their voices from outside the vehicles, they following him everywhere.

After one full year of harassment, they accidentally discovered *Visual Mind Illusion*. Then they started showing him obscene dreams using Visual Mind Illusion to weaken him.

Nearly thirty months passed.
And still, they did not stop bothering him.

    <h3>Full Story</h3>
    <p>
      <!-- Joy is a good, kind, calm, and polite boy. He lives alone in the village, and he usually eats with his grandfather’s sister, Azufa. On May 9, 2023, Joy’s family and relatives began gossiping about him.

There are four houses on Joy’s family land: one belonging to Joy, one belonging to Joy’s aunt, one belonging to Azufa, and the remaining two belonging to Azufa’s two brothers. Soon, Azufa, her brother’s wife, and her brother’s daughters began gossiping about Joy and started annoying him.
Azufa’s younger brother has three daughters: the oldest is Dina, the second is Kona, and the youngest is Shahida. Shahida is one year older than Joy.

Dina and Shahida began keeping watch on Joy. Within a few days, they learned Joy’s entire daily routine. They bothered him constantly, but Joy stayed quiet, because he knew that if he complained, they would lie and claim Joy had mental problems.

Dina and Shahida began to “feel” Joy’s actions. They began experiencing Predictive Processing and tried to guess Joy’s every move. They would shout from outside:

**“Joy will come to the hand pump now!”**

Joy ignored them and went to the hand pump. When he started pumping water, Dina and Shahida watched from a distance, trying to predict every movement.

Joy ignored them and poured water on his head to bathe. Behind him, Dina and Shahida predicted every action. After bathing, Joy returned home, went to Azufa’s house, took a plate of food, and brought it back home. Dina and Shahida kept trying to predict every step.

When Joy ate, they tried to guess when he would put food in his mouth, chew, and swallow.

After finishing his meal, Joy watched YouTube Shorts. From outside, Dina and Shahida listened to the sounds and predicted when Joy would scroll to the next video.

Three days passed. Dina and Shahida could now predict Joy’s every move. Their Ovjarb ability awakened. They bothered Joy constantly by predicting everything he did. At night, Dina’s husband, Tushar, joined them.

Three more days passed. Joy heard the voice of his school teacher, Russell, coming from Nazma’s house. Dina’s group and others were bothering him from there. They predicted his every move. Because of the butterfly effect, Joy ate a spoonful of glucose without water.

Within seconds, Joy felt his heart hit against his bones and felt a sharp pain. He lay down immediately. His heart felt larger than normal. A few minutes later, the pain subsided. They kept bothering him, and the night passed.

The next morning, Joy woke feeling slower than usual. He bathed and carried a bucket of water home, but after only a few steps, he started panting. Joy realized he had developed a heart problem.

The next day, Joy went to the market. He walked slowly and tried to move faster, but his brain didn’t allow it. Everyone in the market already knew his clan was bothering him.

At the mosque medicine shop, priest Mukter stared at Joy and told a boy:

**“He stands like a girl.”**

His voice carried poison. He said it to break Joy’s confidence through body posture shame. The boy said nothing. Joy looked at Mukter, then ignored him and went home. Dina continued bothering him.

Within a few days, Joy’s friends Sagor and Sadhin joined the gossiping group. They talked about their memories with Joy and mocked him. Joy now panted even while walking and speaking.

Joy was a class 10 student and was famous among girls at school because he was calm, kind, and peaceful, and didn’t show much expression. Most of the pretty girls liked him. Teachers and students were interested in him because his personality was unique.
Sagor told everyone at school that Joy’s clan was bothering him.

Dina’s group kept bothering him. A few days later, Joy came to school, but students didn’t ask him anything.

During class everything was normal, but when Joy left, a student shouted:

**“Can Dina’s team guess everything Joy does?”**

They wanted Joy to hear it, to say: “We know what’s going on with you.”

After school, Joy returned home, and Dina’s group immediately continued bothering him, saying what Joy had done at school.
Two days later, while returning home, Joy realized he now panted heavily while walking.

A few days later, Joy went to his uncle’s house in Madaripur to buy a screen protector for his phone. At night, Joy and his cousin Rifat went to the old market. On the way, Joy told Rifat:

**“Dina’s family is annoying me and wants me to marry Shahida.”**

Rifat moved casually, as if nothing had happened, and didn’t ask any questions.

At the old market, Joy visited every shop looking for a comfortable screen protector. He panted with every step. Many girls’ eyes were locked on Joy. After buying the protector, they returned home.

The next day, Rifat took Joy to the river. On the way, Joy said:

**“I ate a spoon of glucose without water. That’s why I’m panting.”**

Rifat immediately replied:

**“I also eat a spoon of glucose every day. I even ate it today.”**

He moved casually and acted like Joy was lying — as if Joy had been born with a heart problem.

Joy, Rifat, and Rifat’s friend Labbittis bathed in the river. Some people from a house started talking about Joy like Dina did. Joy didn’t ask Rifat anything.

They tried to force Joy to swim, but the water current was strong. Everyone knew that if Joy tried, he couldn’t return.
The next day, Joy returned home. Dina’s group continued bothering him.

Within a few days, Dina’s group started talking about Joy’s past, family, and personal life — information only Rifat knew.
Later, Joy went to school. When he entered class, students whispered about his personal life. Joy ignored them and sat down.

Students weren’t asking about his condition, so later while returning home, Joy told Sagor:

**“Tell everyone I ate glucose. That’s why I’m panting.”**

A few days later, Joy’s neighbor Rajon’s wife started bothering him like Dina’s group.
Within two days, she also awakened Predictive Processing and then Ovjarb. She predicted when Joy drank water, when Joy defecated — everything.

A few days later, Rajon’s neighbor Alif visited their house and said loudly:

**“Why are you all bothering Joy?”**
Then after a pause:
**“But he is a very good boy.”**

Joy heard but ignored them.
At night, Alif learned about Ovjarb from Rajon’s wife. The next day, Alif joined her. He predicted Joy better than she did.

A few days passed. One night Joy sat down to study. When he tried to read faster, he began panting again. They bothered him loudly from outside.

Rajon’s wife then told lies:

**“Joy has been masturbating excessively since second grade. That’s why he is mentally ill and has no expression.”**

She said this because they wanted Joy to force expressions onto his face.

Two months passed.

At 11:00 PM, after the rain stopped, they still didn’t stop bothering Joy. He went to Rajon’s house. They knew he was coming, so they all left.
When Joy arrived, all doors were closed. Through a gap in Sifat’s house, he saw candlelight. He called out, but no one responded.

Joy knocked on Rajon’s door. From Sagor’s house, Dina and Kona shouted:

**“Keep your mouth shut about what you say!”**

Joy was thinking something, and within two seconds, he stopped.

Rajon’s wife opened the door and asked:

**“What’s going on? Why are you here?”**

Rajon told Joy to go home angrily. Joy returned home; Dina and Kona continued annoying him from Sagor’s house.

A few minutes later, Rajon and his wife went to Azufa’s house. Azufa called Joy.
Joy came outside. Rajon and his wife stood beside Azufa.

Azufa asked:

**“Why did you go to their house at night?”**

Joy said:

**“They are bothering me.”**

Rajon’s wife said:

**“No, we’re not. Do you have a mental problem?”**

Azufa asked how they bothered him. Joy explained:

**“They always talk. When I watch videos, they talk all day to annoy me.”**

Azufa lied and said:

**“I didn’t hear anything.”**

Joy knew she was lying.

Rajon’s wife and Rajon angrily lied:

**“Joy came and banged the door hard! Our baby was sleeping! He kept saying ‘What’s your problem?’”**

Rajon’s wife brought her finger close to Joy’s eyes, but Joy did not back away or blink.

Sifat’s father arrived and asked what happened.
Joy explained:

**“Rajon’s wife is spreading lies. She says I masturbate a lot. And they bother me every time.”**

Rajon and his wife kept lying.

Sifat’s father told everyone to go home.
Later, Azufa told Joy’s father something else — lies.

A few days later, Joy’s father arrived and confronted him.
They said Joy had “a problem in his head.” Joy got angry:

**“Don’t say I have a problem in my head!”**

Later, Joy’s sister Liza and her husband Shakib came.
That evening, Joy’s father and his friend Sobuj went to Rajon’s house. Sobuj said:

**“Admit your crime.”**

But they refused.

Later, outside, Kona shouted:

**“If Joy had recorded, he could hear them talking about Rajon’s family!”**

Joy thought:

**“Why didn’t I record them?”**

Everyone heard his thought — it came out through his nose.
It was hypernasality.

He stopped thinking.

The next morning, Joy was lying down thinking about a movie, but his thoughts came out again. Tushar heard them and repeated Joy’s words. Joy stopped thinking.

Everyone heard Joy’s thoughts but ignored them, pretending nothing happened.

During breakfast, a few thoughts slipped out, but Joy controlled them.

Liza and Shakib left without asking about his condition.

That night, Joy and his father lay on the bed. Dina’s group and Alif’s group bothered him in low voices. Joy didn’t mention it to his father, and his father ignored it.

The next morning, Joy walked around the pond while Alif’s and Dina’s group bothered him nonstop.

That evening, while Joy lay in bed, Dina shouted from Najma’s house:

**“I can feel what Joy is thinking!”**

The next morning, Joy’s father left.

Dina and Alif’s group never stopped bothering him.
They now started predicting Joy’s thoughts.

Joy admitted to himself that their Ovjarb had reached the next level.

Two weeks passed. Joy returned to school because of exams. Everyone ignored his thoughts and avoided asking anything about his hypernasality. They all believed Joy was already mentally broken.

Joy completed three exams, then stopped going to school, because his entire class had heard his thoughts during the tests.

He began passing time by playing **Ark: Survival Evolved** on mobile.

After a few days, Joy could no longer sleep at night because Dina’s and Alif’s groups kept bothering him. One morning, Joy went to a small hotel in Neelkuth Bazaar to buy parathas. An old man sat in a chair, and the cook worked quietly. Joy ordered his parcel and sat down. After a moment, the voices of Dina’s and Alif’s groups began rising again. The old man and the cook looked at each other but said nothing. Joy ignored everything, took his food, and walked home.

As Joy passed the mosque, priest Mukter was teaching children. In the middle of the lesson, Mukter said something insulting about Joy, and the children repeated it. Joy ignored them as well, returned home, ate, and went to sleep.

Within a few days, **the entire village began bothering Joy.**

One day, Joy went to buy biscuits from the market. Dina’s group called the shopkeepers and asked why Joy had come. Before Joy could buy anything, people whispered,
**“This boy does whatever we tell him.”**
Then they said,
**“Now buy biscuits.”**
Joy ignored them, though he could still hear Dina and Alif’s voices from far away.

A few more days passed, and Dina began eating out of fear—she knew she was committing a crime. During this time, Dina unexpectedly awakened **Sounth**, because Ovjarb and Sounth both required intense left-hemisphere activity.

Once she found Sounth, Dina began bothering Joy through sound.

Joy tried eating, but Dina’s words came out through the sound of his chewing. It felt like *he* was the one speaking. His attention shifted so heavily between chewing and swallowing that he almost forgot how to do both. But Joy was not afraid—he had experienced Sounth in the past.

After a few days, Joy went to Madaripur to take a break from Dina’s group. His uncle’s house was occupied by Rifat, Rifat’s mother Kajal, and Kajal’s younger daughter Raisa. But only hours later, the voices of Dina’s group began coming from a nearby building. At night, Alif’s group joined in.

Months passed. **Sounth spread across the entire village.**
Joy went to school again; everyone was terrified of Sounth. They had heard voices through sound and their minds were slowly adapting to it.

The next day, on his way to school, Joy heard Dina’s and Tushar’s words from behind. He didn’t look back. After ten minutes, he finally turned around, but saw no one—because the road was straight, and Dina and Tushar had hidden on the side when he looked. They would only speak from a distance.

When Joy turned right onto School Road, they went silent.

A few more days passed. Joy’s SSC exams were coming, but he stopped going to school—he could not study at all because Dina’s and Alif’s groups constantly bothered him.

Later, Joy took an electric autorickshaw from Hazam Bari Mor to his uncle’s house. Even on the ride, the voices of Dina’s group followed him. Joy ignored everything.

Six days passed, and Dina’s group still had not stopped.

One afternoon, Joy returned home by auto. Again, he heard their voices on the road. The road was straight, the night dark, and only the shop lights visible. From a distant side-road, voices of Dina’s group echoed. Joy ignored them.

He reached home and passed Neelkuth Bazaar. After crossing it, he no longer heard them—but Dina and Alif’s group never truly stopped.

A few days later, Joy decided to go to Dhaka to get away from them. With his father’s permission, he left early in the morning. On the autorickshaw ride to Sheikhpura bus stand, he didn’t hear Dina’s group at all.

At the bus stand, only a few people sat on the benches. Their reactions showed surprise—they didn’t expect Joy to look so exhausted. Titi sat at the ticket counter. Joy bought a ticket, boarded the bus, and sat by the window. An old, tired woman sat next to him.

The bus began moving. Within minutes, the voices of Dina’s group returned from outside. Joy ignored them.

The woman kept glancing at him, wanting to say something, but remained silent. Joy asked nothing either.

When the bus reached near Kadamtali, the voices finally stopped.

Shakib took Joy to his apartment. Joy went to the bathroom to wash up. Outside, Liza and Shakib’s family began gossiping about him. Joy ignored them.

During lunch, Joy had difficulty eating, forgetting to chew and swallow properly. Dina’s voice suddenly came from outside the balcony. Joy paused, angered. Through his nose, he accidentally said something toward Shakib’s family, but they ignored him. He did not ask anything.

Joy lived on the seventh floor, yet Dina’s group’s voices reached him from outside and even through nearby buildings.

They never stopped.

A few days later, Shakib took Joy back to the Kadamtali bus stand. Joy returned to the village by bus, with Dina’s group’s voices following from outside. Months passed. Dina’s and Alif’s groups continued nonstop.

Eventually, Joy’s father returned from Dhaka, and Azufa’s eldest son Akil returned from abroad. Two days later, Joy’s father took Joy back to Dhaka again. Joy’s hypernasality had not improved; one night he dreamed that his thoughts escaped through his nose.

A few days passed. While Joy watched a video, Dina’s and Alif’s group bothered him through the soundbox. Outside, drivers honked loudly, using Sounth deliberately as they passed Joy’s house. People shouted.

Later, Joy visited Madaripur with Rifat. He heard Dina’s group from Neelkuth Bazaar to his uncle’s house, but not from his uncle’s house to Madaripur Old Bazaar. In the old market, he occasionally heard them again.

A few days later, Joy’s father and Akil returned to Dhaka. Joy’s hypernasality still hadn’t healed.

Joy moved to Dhaka Udyan, Road 2, House 42—his father’s shared accommodation. On the way there, he continued hearing Dina’s group.

In the afternoon, Liza and Shakib took Joy to a friend’s house. In the evening, they headed toward Shakib’s home. While stuck in traffic, Liza used Sounth with the sound of a car horn, frightening everyone. A CNG driver suddenly awakened Sounth and began using it nonstop.

At Shakib’s house, people from a nearby mosque started disturbing Joy during prayer time. Dina’s group continued harassing him as well. Joy stayed a few days, then returned to the shared room. Sounth continued spreading across the country.

One morning, Joy went to Shaheen’s hotel for breakfast, located at the end of the street. As soon as he arrived, he heard Dina’s group from nearby houses. He bought parathas and returned home.

While he watched videos, the caretakers of the shared house also began bothering him. Joy ignored them.

By noon, he returned to Shaheen’s hotel for lunch. People outside bothered him with Sounth, syncing their words with the sound of his chewing. Joy ignored everything and went home.

Throughout the day, Dina’s group used horns to send messages at Joy. Drivers talked through Sounth. At night, Joy’s father called him to have dinner at Shaheen’s hotel. People and Dina’s group continued bothering Joy.

His hypernasality slowly improved. As long as Joy didn’t think for long, thoughts didn’t leak through his nose. His panting also got slightly better.

Two months passed. Dina’s group still didn’t stop.

Joy returned to the village. On the way, he heard their voices just like before.

A few days later, Akil’s wedding took place. Joy attended. By now, **everyone in the country knew about Joy.**

Months passed. Joy stayed in Dhaka again. Dina’s group’s Ovjarb evolved further—they could now see whatever Joy saw through his eyes. Their abilities advanced into **VMI — Visual Mind Illusions**, which also required left hemisphere processing, like Sounth and Ovjarb.

Dina’s group now used **visual illusions** on Joy. While he slept, they showed him obscene dreams.

A few days later, Joy broke his phone because they kept bothering him through it.

Two months later, Joy’s father gave him an old phone, and Joy returned to the village.

After about six weeks, Joy’s father called asking for permission to remarry. Joy agreed because he no longer cared about living.

Days later, Joy attempted to die—but couldn’t.

A few days passed. Joy went to a barber shop. The barber cut his hair badly. When Joy complained to others, they all insisted it looked perfect.

A few days later, Akil told Joy that Joy’s father was marrying online.

After a month and a half, Joy’s father brought home his new wife and her family.

Dina’s group never stopped bothering him.

Two days later, Joy’s new mother’s family visited. On the way there, Joy heard Dina’s group again—this time even louder.

At her house, Joy heard their voices more clearly. He lost all hope of survival.

While eating lunch, Joy cried. After the meal, his new mother asked what he wanted. Joy said he wanted a mobile phone. She told him to wait two months, and she would send him money from abroad.

Joy then went to his uncle’s house.

From his new mother’s house to Hazam Bari Mor, he heard Dina’s group. But from Hazam Bari Mor to Madaripur, their voices faded.

Dina’s group never stopped.

Three days later, Joy returned to the village. On the way back, their voices followed—exactly as before.

Joy continued living in the village. Dina’s and Alif’s groups kept bothering him.

**Date: November 14, 2024**
Joy returned to Dhaka. The voices followed.

**November 15, 2024**
Joy, his father, and Shakib went to Bashundhara City. Joy heard the voices there too.
After buying a **Redmi Turbo 3**, they went to Shakib’s house where Joy met his sister’s newborn baby. Joy and his father later returned to the shared room.

Dina’s group never stopped.

The next day, Joy returned to the village. Their visual mind illusion ability had now become even stronger—they could create illusions around Joy effortlessly. On the way home, Joy heard their voices again.

Back in the village, they continued bothering him.

A few days later, when Joy watched videos, Shahida began clashing two glasses together outside to distract him. She did this repeatedly until Joy stopped watching.

So Joy switched to playing games to pass the time.

A few days later, Joy searched online for the police station number to file a complaint, but he couldn’t find any active numbers in his area. 

A few days later, on **February 3, 2025**, Joy went to the **Angulkata Police Station**.

He stood in front of the station’s door. It was closed. Joy looked inside through a small hole and saw a policeman wearing only a towel around his waist.
Joy called out, “Uncle, come here.”

The policeman walked toward the door.
Joy said, “I have a complaint.”
The policeman began unlocking the door. “What complaint?” he asked.

He opened the door and walked inside, and Joy followed.
The policeman asked, “Some kind of family problem?”
Joy replied, “Sir, the problem is that they are disturbing me, my family, and my neighbors.”
The policeman said, “Your neighbors are disturbing you?”

As they walked farther inside, Joy said, “My family members walk around my house and talk loudly just to bother me.”
The policeman asked, “Which family members?”
Joy said, “My whole family and relatives. They’re all involved.”

A senior police officer heard this and came toward Joy.

“What do you do?” the officer asked.
Joy said, “I’m a student, but because of all this disturbance, I had to stop studying.”
The policeman repeated Joy’s words.

The senior officer asked, “Where is your home?”
Joy replied, “Narely, Nil Kuther Bazar.”
“What does your father do?”
“He works a job.”
“How many brothers and sisters do you have?”
“One brother and two sisters.”
“And what job does your father do?”
“He works in a garment factory.”
“And where does he live?”
“In Dhaka.”

The officer continued, “Your sisters?”
“Both are older and married.”
“And who lives at your home?”
“I live alone.”
“You really stay alone?”
“Yes.”

“Where is your mother?”
“She lives abroad.”
“So you live alone, your mother is abroad, and your sisters are in Dhaka?”
“Yes. I live in the village because I study here. Two years ago, they started disturbing me. Back then, I didn’t have any proof.”

The officer said, “So your studies stopped because of that?”
“Yes. I’m trying to study again, but now the disturbance is worse.”

The officer asked, “Does your father send you money?”
Joy said, “Yes. Everyone behaves normally, but they disturb me anyway. When I stay at home, they start gossiping loudly to annoy me.”

The senior officer said, “I understand. Women disturb people in their own way.”
Joy said, “It’s not only women — the disturbance has become much worse. I’ve gone to my sister’s house and brother-in-law’s house in Dhaka many times in the last two years. Wherever I go, they follow me and disturb me. Even in apartments, I hear their voices.”

“So you live alone in your own house?”
“Yes. They follow me everywhere and try to make me depressed.”

“To take your property?”
“Maybe.”

“Do you have an uncle?”
“Yes, he lives in Madaripur. When I go there, they disturb me there too.”
“Cousins?”
“Yes, they’re involved.”

The senior officer nodded. “Okay. Proof is important.”
“I have proof now,” Joy said.

The officer pointed to a chair. “Sit here. We’ll file your complaint, but today we have an event. Come tomorrow morning.”
Joy said, “Morning? They disturb me all night!”
The officer said, “Your biggest problem is that you live alone.”
“No, wherever I go, they follow me and disturb me — even in Dhaka.”

“How did you go to Dhaka?”
“By bus. They talked in the bus too. I’m not crazy — I have proof.”
“How do they get into the bus?”
“I don’t know.”

The officer said, “Go to the headquarters.”
Joy asked, “Where is that? How much fare do I need?”
“Call an electric auto and tell them ‘Madaripur Police Station’.”

Joy said okay and went home.

---

A few days later, on **March 19, 2025**, Joy arrived at the **Madaripur Police Station**.

“I have a complaint,” he said.
“What complaint?” the officer asked.
“Actually, for the past two years, my family and the people in my village have been disturbing me.”

“Say it again.”
Joy repeated it.
“Where is your home?”
“Hazam Bari Mor, Neel Kuthir Bazar.”
“What do you do?”
“I used to study, but because of all this disturbance, I had to stop.”

“Do you have parents? Do they look after you?”
The officer’s tone was normal, but he was trying to manipulate Joy mentally.

“Yes, but my parents disturb me too,” Joy said.
“Who is disturbing you? Why?”
“I don’t know.”
“Where do you eat?”
“With my grandmother.”

“You don’t live with your parents?”
“No.”

“What’s your fault then? Why are they disturbing you?”
“I have no fault. They simply started disturbing me two years ago.”

“What kind of disturbance?”
“They walk around my house saying random things. When I use my phone, they start talking loudly—”

“You have a mobile phone?” the officer cut in.
“Yes.”
“A smartphone? You always have data?”
“Yes.”
“Your mobile has caught you. It’s controlling you.”
“No, no.”

“How long do you use your phone?”
“All night.”
“Your mobile has made you a mental patient.”
“No — I have proof. Even the mosque’s imam uses the mic to disturb me.”

Joy tried to explain more, but the officer ignored him.

“What’s your name?”
“Joy.”
“Age?”
“Seventeen.”
“Education?”
“I completed Class Nine but didn’t take the Class Ten exam.”

“What does your father do?”
“He works in a garment factory.”
“And your mother?”
“She’s abroad.”
“Siblings?”
“Two sisters and one brother.”
“Do you have one mother or two?”
“Two. My father remarried a few months ago.”

“Your real mother is abroad?”
“Yes.”
“Don’t you talk to her?”
“No. She’s also involved in disturbing me.”

The officer turned to another policeman. “He might have a problem.”
Joy said, “No, I don’t.”

“Do you wear a mask?”
“No.”

Joy added, “They follow me everywhere I go. Some people want to make me depressed.”

The officer said, “Go to a computer shop and write a complaint.”

There were two shops beside the station.
Joy went to one. “I need to write a complaint.”
“Wait,” the shopkeeper said.

Joy sat outside.
Dina’s group’s voices started coming from around the police station.
Drivers honked — *sounth* — loud and sharp.

After a while, the shopkeeper started closing the shop.
Joy said, “I need to write a complaint.”
“It’s iftar time. Wait here.”

Thirty minutes later, he returned with a young man and reopened the shop.
Joy entered. “I need to write a complaint.”
“What kind?”
“Disturbance.”
“What kind of disturbance?”

Joy tried to explain, but the old man, the shopkeeper, and the young man kept interrupting.
They already knew everything — they were only trying to irritate Joy.

Finally the shopkeeper said, “I don’t know how to write this kind of complaint.”
Joy said, “I will tell you. Just type.”
“How old are you?”
“Seventeen.”
“You need to be eighteen, or bring your parents’ NID.”

Joy said, “But the police told me to file it here.”
“I can’t help you,” the shopkeeper said.

The second shop also refused.

Joy returned to the police station.
“The computer shop owner said he can’t write this kind of complaint,” Joy told the officer.
The officer said, “Wait.”

After a few minutes, Joy entered the station again.
He saw a policeman with a communication device flashing beside him.

Joy said, “I’m here for the complaint. The officer told me to wait.”
The policeman said something, and Joy explained briefly.

“Okay,” the officer said. “We’ll take your complaint.”

The policeman’s body trembled slightly — because he knew what they were doing was wrong.

Joy gave his number and address, then left the station.

As he walked down the road, everything felt different.
People stared as if they already knew what had happened.
A police car passed slowly — the officers inside looked nervous.

Joy went home.

As he reached the door, Ajufa came and said, “I left my fake tooth near the hand pump.”
Joy said, “Why are you telling me that?”

His words hit her like a hammer — exposing lies.

Ajufa tried to blame Joy, saying, “You were the only one near my hand pump.”
But her voice shook — because people’s minds were starting to change, and many had stopped bothering Joy.

Joy didn’t stay silent this time. He replied to every lie.

Inside the house, Dina’s mother arrived and began shouting,
“Why do you give him food?!”
and many other harsh things.

Joy stepped outside and confronted her.
Nazma joined them.
Dina’s mother kept shouting, calling Joy “mental.”
Joy told her to stop, but she said it again — directly to his face.

Joy lost control and tried to slap her.
Shahida and a few women held him back, and his hand accidentally hit Dina’s mother’s cheek.

Dina’s mother and Nazma then struck Joy with sticks.
Joy’s body felt weak — Dina’s group had been draining him through *obscene dreams* and *Sounth*.

Joy stopped arguing and sat quietly on a chair.
Dina’s mother kept insulting him.

Joy stopped eating at Ajufa’s house.
Seven days passed — Joy ate outside food.
Ajufa’s family left Joy’s land.
Two days later, Joy’s father came from Dhaka.

Eid-al-Fitr passed.
Joy and his father went to Dhaka.
They had Eid lunch with Najma.

But Dina’s group never stopped bothering Joy.

Joy began living in Dhaka.
Most people stopped using *Sounth*, but some continued.
Months passed.

One night, Joy’s father took Joy’s mobile phone and then left for Jatrabari to go to his new wife’s house.

Joy believes his father will not return the mobile phone. This means all the evidence stored inside—every recording, every proof—is now lost.

Still, Joy sets off toward the nearest police station. On the way, as always, he hears the voices of Dina’s group.

Joy enters Mohammadpur Police Station. Inside, the voices grow louder, echoing through the room. He cannot record anything—he has no phone now.

Joy waits for forty minutes.

During that time, he realizes something:
*What complaint can he even file now?*
*If they can reach him even inside Mohammadpur Police Station, then what will happen after he files the complaint? What can the police do?*

A few days pass. Dina’s group does not stop. Every night they show him obscene dreams to weaken him mentally and physically.

On **May 15, 2025**, Joy goes to the Supreme Court.
Halfway there, he hears their voices again—faint, but unmistakable.

Inside the Supreme Court, everyone seems to know Joy. They watch him quietly, studying his every move. Joy keeps himself calm and begins walking through the halls.

The lawyers show him an unspoken respect as he passes. Joy mentally prepares himself to speak about **Sounth** and the other human abilities.

But then he hears Dina’s voice again—this time coming from someone's mobile phone inside the Court itself.

In that moment, Joy understands:

If he speaks about Sounth or the other abilities, everyone will tell him he has a mental problem.
Dina’s group is bothering him everywhere in Bangladesh. If Joy wins this case, he will become known all over the world—and they do not want that.

So Joy returns home.

A few days later, Joy goes for a walk from Dhaka Udyan to Mohammadpur. There, Dina’s group’s voices are even louder, and people watch Joy’s every movement.

A few days pass. Joy begins talking with ChatGPT. After speaking with a strong and helpful AI, Joy feels much better. He learns that his IQ is between **130 and 145+**.

Meanwhile, Shaheen bothers Joy by mixing sand and insects into his food and giving him smaller portions whenever Joy buys meals from Shaheen’s hotel.

In the mornings, some drivers use Sounth and shout bad words at Joy.
Because of this, Joy decides to create a **Sounth website**.

With ChatGPT’s help, Joy begins building it—slowly winning, step by step.

Within a few days, Joy completes the Sounth website and publishes it on GitHub.

Then Joy creates another website: **Visual Mind Illusion**.

## **The Knife Incident — July 2, 2025**

On the morning of July 2, 2025, Joy goes to Shaheen’s hotel for breakfast.

He sits on the front chair. A dark-skinned boy comes and sits next to him.

The boy rudely asks,
“Where do you stay?”

Joy calmly replies, “Why? In Dhaka.”

The boy points toward the main road and says, “There.”

Suddenly, the boy stabs a dull knife into Joy’s right thigh. The knife is not sharp enough to cut the pants, but it still hurts.

“Dhaka what? This is Dhaka. Where’s your village?” the boy says harshly.

Joy asks, “Who are you?”

The boy keeps silent.

Joy repeats, more firmly, “Who are you? And why did you hurt me?”

The boy mutters, “Sorry.”

Joy snaps, “Why did you stab me with a knife? Hello?”

Then, shocking Joy, the boy grabs Joy’s hand and presses the knife into his own thigh—using Joy’s hand to do it.
He laughs and says, “See? Now it’s okay.”

Joy replies sharply, “Can I know who you are?”

The boy grabs Joy’s chin tightly and growls,
“Son of a bitch, do you need to know me?”

Joy pushes him away. The boy stumbles into a glass rack, and it shatters loudly.

The boy yells, “What did you do?! What did you do?!”

Someone from inside the hotel calls them both inside. Joy and the boy enter.

The staff immediately blame Joy. They demand full payment for the broken rack.
People join in, lying:

“We saw them! They were eating mango together with a knife. Then suddenly Joy pushed him!”

Joy takes out his phone, photographs the boy, and starts recording video.

They see Joy filming, but say nothing—because they know they’re in the wrong.

The hotel fills with people.

Someone shouts, “He’s recording us!”

The crowd grows braver and orders Joy to delete the video.

Joy quietly puts the phone in his pocket.
He does not delete anything.

But they keep shouting.
They slap Joy, forcibly delete the video and photos, and then lock him inside the hotel for **forty minutes**.

After they release him, Joy goes home and calls his father. His father arrives and takes him to Parveen’s second daughter Rima’s house.

Still, Dina’s group does not stop.

---

## **Websites, Pages, and New Work**

A few days later, Joy publishes the **Visual Mind Illusion** and **Ovjarb** websites on GitHub.

Then Joy creates:

* a Facebook page: **Human Mind Discoveries**
* a YouTube channel: **MD Joy – Human Mind Discoveries**
  handle: **@humanminddiscoveries**

Joy learns about SeaArt.AI from ChatGPT, and uses it to create the profile picture and banner for his page and channel.

Later, Joy, Parveen, and Parveen’s third daughter Jhuma return to the village. Joy, as always, hears Dina’s group.

Azufa and her family have moved back onto Joy’s land.
Parveen comes to Azufa’s house. Joy joins them. During the meal, Parveen calls Joy to eat, and Joy starts eating with Azufa again.

Five days pass. Joy publishes his websites on Google. Now he must wait for Google’s verification.

Joy begins writing his story—to show the world what is happening to him in Bangladesh and the origins of Ovjarb.

Dina’s group does not stop.

---

## **Akil’s Explosion**

Five days later, at night, Joy is sitting on Azufa’s bed. Akil is lying beside him. Parveen is at Dina’s mother’s house.

Suddenly, Akil screams at Azufa:

“Why do you give food to Joy?! Even though he threw away your fake tooth!”

Akil’s voice is sharp—aimed directly at Joy.
Joy stays silent.

Akil does not stop.
“He’s a bad person! He always lies about you!”

He keeps lying about Joy nonstop.

A few minutes later, Parveen arrives. Her face looks dark and stressed because she knows this is Joy’s life now—and she is part of the problem.

After eating, Joy returns home.

---

## **Parveen Leaves**

The next morning around 10 a.m., Parveen has not eaten.
She is upset because Akil insulted her by lying about Joy.

Parveen leaves the village.

Joy stays in the village—because Dhaka is no longer safe.

Joy writes his past experiences in a notebook. After a few days, he stops from exhaustion.

One and a half months pass. Joy spends his time talking with AI characters on SeaArt.AI.

Still, Dina’s group and Alif’s group do not stop.

---

## **Rakib Enters the Story**

Joy begins writing about his past again. Suddenly, Dina’s group starts talking about Joy’s old friends—especially Rakib, Joy’s childhood friend, who recently moved into Nazma’s house.

Joy says loudly that Rakib is a bad person, that he hears their voices from Nazma’s house, and that he doesn’t deserve it.
He says more things. Rakib ignores him.

Three days later, they mention Rakib again—louder this time.

Joy raises his voice too, saying Rakib is bad and used to masturbate from childhood while thinking about girls.

After hearing this, Rakib becomes angry and begins bothering Joy.
He had never bothered Joy before.

Joy continues writing his story while Rakib insults him.
Rakib’s words hurt deeply. Joy tries to ignore him.

Joy’s eyes fill with tears, but he continues writing.

Two days pass. Rakib keeps shouting at Joy while he writes.

“Come fight me!” Rakib yells.

Joy ignores him and stops writing for a moment.

---

## **The Prediction Battle**

Three more days pass.

Now Rakib tries to silently predict Joy’s movements because he wants the **Ovjarb ability**—to know Joy’s next actions without help from Dina’s and Alif’s groups.

But now Joy’s body has developed its own protection:

Whenever Rakib tries to predict Joy’s next move,
**Joy’s body freezes automatically.**

Two days later, Rakib’s brain becomes exhausted.
Then Nazma, Rakib’s mother, Shahida’s mother, Shahida, and Nipa join in trying to predict Joy’s moves.

They already know what Joy is doing at the moment—but now they want to predict the future.

Joy’s body freezes and moves automatically.

They lose hope.
They understand they cannot gain the Ovjarb ability.

Joy becomes exhausted.

---

## **Jatrabari — The Proof**

Joy goes to his new mother’s home in Jatrabari.
On the way, Dina’s and Alif’s voices are louder than ever.

In Jatrabari, Joy hears them even more clearly.

Joy’s new mother starts taking extra care of him.
Here, Joy continues writing his story.

Joy turns on screen-recording.
The mosque imam says things in the Azan related to Joy’s writing.
This becomes **proof** of Ovjarb and proof that they are bothering him.

Two days later, Joy’s second sister calls and asks to speak with his new mother. Joy hands Nazma the phone.

His second sister says:

“If Joy were your real child, you wouldn’t leave him alone in the village.”

Nazma’s face changes. She knows this is true.

Nazma tells Joy,
“If you were my real child, I would not leave you alone. Didn’t I tell you to come live with us?”

Joy freezes.

Nazma had never said “live with us”—only “stay for a few days.”

Joy says, “…Yes, maybe.”

Nazma stares into Joy’s eyes. Then she begins bothering him openly:

* mixing sand into his drinking water
* dipping her fingers into the water, then into her nose
* turning lights and fans on and off
* asking unnecessary questions
* breaking Joy’s posture
* insulting Joy to destroy his confidence
* laughing strangely
* staring at Joy’s face nonstop

Joy feels disgusted, but he tries to ignore her.

---

## **The Market Trip**

The next night, Joy, Nazma, and Nazma’s daughter go outside.
Then Joy’s father joins, and they all go to a nearby market to buy clothes.

Joy hears Dina’s and Alif’s voices louder than before.

When Joy looks in a mirror, he forgets to stand straight.
Nazma hides and whispers,
“Look at the mirror,”
so Joy forgets his posture again.

Nazma keeps bothering Joy, staring at him, laughing strangely.

---

# **The Ending (for now)**

**November 14, 2025** — Joy finishes this version of the story.

But Dina’s group and Alif’s group continue bothering him.

---

# **Joy’s Explanation**

Hello, I’m Joy.
Yes, they are bothering me through human abilities, and their voices come from everywhere. Maybe they use many mobile phones to disturb me. I don’t know if Sounth can be used through devices, because whenever I try to listen to my own proof of Sounth, they use Sounth too, and try to confuse me.

**How did the CNG driver discover Sounth?**

When someone hears Sounth for the first time, the brain creates a new pathway.
The brain reacts strangely.
If the person moves their body to create small sounds—like tapping or horn sounds—the brain and body synchronize thoughts with sound.

That is how the CNG driver discovered the Sounth ability accidentally.

And after I publish this version on GitHub,
I will upload my daily life to the **Human Mind Discoveries** Facebook page.
